Throughout this paper, we traced the history of Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Neuroscience, Philosophy and a host of other disciplines united towards a deeper understanding of intelligence and the mind. All mentioned disciplines have gone through various phases, but our approach mainly focused on their relationship to symbolic and connectionist models. After the historical perspective, we used the papers we mentioned to trace a cross-historical view of research trends. In a dedicated section, we finally explored recent avenues for symbolic and connectionist integration. This document is meant to serve as both an introductory path through the history of the disciplines, as many insights are to be gained by considering past proposals in relationship to present paradigms, and as a general picture for how trends move through discoveries, critiques and research.
