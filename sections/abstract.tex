Due to the complex nature of the matter discussed, the relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science is often misrepresented. This is, in part, due to ignorance of the disciplines considered, which range from Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science to Philosophy, Psychology and Neuroscience. In this text, we attempt to outline the shared history of the study of intelligence, intelligent behavior and rationality. We do this with an especially attentive focus to where paradigms and theories fall on the symbolic-connectionist spectrum. To achieve this, we include technical explanations for some of the theories mentioned. In the final section, we take a cross-historical approach to help identify trends and conclude with a brief overview of symbolic-connectionist integration proposals.
