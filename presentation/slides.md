# Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence
### An interwoven approach

**Supervisor**: Francesco Bianchini
**Author**: Paolo Marzolo


---
## What was studied
History of *cognitive science(s)*, compared and contrasted with the history of *artificial intelligence* and *computer science*. Main interest: are theories...
- **symbol**-oriented: localized representation, high level reasoning, distance from biology
- **connection**-oriented: distributed representation, interest in low level processing, perception, closely related to biology

---
## Rationale behind research

Their shared histories have influenced one another many times. 
- What is there to learn from Cognitive Sciences now?
- Are old paradigms relevant again?
- Which directions seem to hold the most promise?
- What's the current state of research?
---

## Structure of the thesis
- Glossary: included to avoid *weighted* terms
- Historical section: developed in sections, highlights shifts in perspective
- Analysis: 
    - Trends and movements
    - Symbols, subsymbols and hybrid approaches
- Appendix: introduction to neural networks moved here to keep text light
---

## Structure of this presentation
Instead of sections, we'll go through some interesting points throughout the history. 

Then, we'll tackle symbols-subsymbols briefly.

### Symbolic\[Neuro\]

- Monte Carlo Tree Search + NN for state estimation
- Self driving cars
- Great success in game-playing

## Neuro: Symbolic -> Neuro
- Training converts symbolic rules to training pairs
- No correctness guarantee
- E.g: Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics

---

## **Neuro**_Symbolic


- Using symbolic rules as guidelines or *templates* for connectionist structures
- Logic Tensor Networks:
    - formulas -> fuzzy logical reasoning
    - object features -> error minimization
    - all in Neural Network

## Neuro \[Symbolic\]
Kautz ends on these hypothetical models, which would be able to encode and decode into and from a **symbolic** reasoning engine

# Conclusion
In this presention, we went over some relevant passages of the thesis. After some history, we went over the difference between symbol and subsymbol-representations, and ways to integrate them.
